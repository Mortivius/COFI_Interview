# COFI_Interview
Repo containing my coding challenge code for my Capital One Investing interview.

I used Python 2.7.13.

Usage:
1) python main.py [--max-daily-profit] [--busy-day] [--biggest-loser] [--help]
Finds monthly averages for COF, GOOGL, and MSFT from 1/1/17 to 6/30/17. Each bonus flag does what was specified in the problem description, with --help printing the other flags and what they do.

2) Output is written to output.txt. Example output of an invocation with all 3 bonus flags is provided.
